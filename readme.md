  An online tool called CineMaison Cinema Booking System was created to make movie reservations easier. Users may easily explore the movies that are offered, choose showtimes, pick seats, and finish the purchase process. The system has several venues (such as Makati and Manila) and an easy-to-use interface that makes it simple for users to check available seats and order tickets. Users can also create an account in order to manage their reservations. In addition to having choices for controlling payment methods, seat selections, and personal preferences, the system is responsive, guaranteeing seamless operation across several devices.

## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
A web-based platform called the CineMaison Cinema Booking System makes it simple for consumers to explore films, pick showtimes, select seats, and make payments. Its goal is to lower operating costs for movie theaters while offering a convenient, effective, and user-friendly booking experience. Movie listings, seat preference, safe payment processing, and user identification are important elements. Movie scheduling, seat availability, and user information may all be managed by administrators.

For the front end, the system uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; for dynamic components, it uses either vanilla JavaScript or React. PHP or Node.js powers the backend, which stores data in MySQL or PostgreSQL. PayPal and Stripe are examples of safe APIs that are coupled with payment processing. Cloud services like AWS or Heroku offer hosting, and JWT or OAuth manage secure authentication.
